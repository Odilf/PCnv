# Puta converter

First of all, I'm sorry.

This came because there was this one time (like three years ago) that a lot of people started writing "Puta" in a group chat. I though that you could encode actual messages using only the word "puta" if you encoded a message in binary and replaced the zeroes with lowercase letters and the ones with uppercase. Tried to do it, couldn't (I was using Unity xd), so after a long wait I came back and built this in a day. It doesn't deserve more than a day's work, let's be honest here.

Enjoy, i guess.
